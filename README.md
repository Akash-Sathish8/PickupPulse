Pickup Pulse
Pickup Pulse is a mobile-first app concept that helps users find, join, and track real-time pickup basketball and football games at local courts. The app uses GPS-based check-ins, game creation tools, and potential crowd estimation features to connect local athletes more easily.

Note: This project is currently in development and has not yet been deployed. The repository includes wireframes, a clickable Figma prototype, and an initial codebase built using React Native.
